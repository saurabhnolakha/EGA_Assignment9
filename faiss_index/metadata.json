    "chunk": "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally. The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are \"out\"). Dismissal can occur in various ways, including being bowled (when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from traditional Test matches played over five days to the newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which each team bats for a single innings of 20 overs (each \"over\" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasts three to four hours. Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket, they wear club or team colours.",

    "chunk": "In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string. The earliest known definite reference to cricket is to it being played in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Southern Africa, and the West Indies. While traditionally, cricket has largely been played by men, Women's cricket has experienced large growth in the 21st century. The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won eight One Day International trophies, including six World Cups, more than any other country, and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.",

    "chunk": "DLF Limited (formerly Delhi Land & Finance) is an Indian commercial real estate development company. It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this",

The complaint was lodged against DLF by buyers in its residential projects Belaire & Park Place, located in Gurgaon.[19] In February 2015, the CCI ordered its investigative arm to probe two more projects of DLF in Gurgaon, namely, DLF Regal Gardens[20] and DLF Skycourt.[21][22] DLF land grab case pertains to the alleged illegal acquisition of 50 acres of land in Amipur village, Haryana, back in 2013, during Bhupinder Singh Hooda's tenure as Chief Minister under the Congress government. This matter has led to an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation involving Robert Vadra, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, and the DLF, as of around December 2017.[23]",

Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. DLF is committed to waste minimisation and promoting efficient use of resources throughout the lifecycle of construction and portfolio management. It undertakes several measures to reduce, reuse or recycle waste generated from the business activities. - Project-specific plans are put in place for efficient resource use and waste recycling, prior to initiating construction. DLF also work with customers and waste disposal companies to introduce recycling systems into leases for rental buildings; - Contractors engaged in construction are encouraged to recover, reuse and recycle building materials; - The Company educates its employees, tenants and contractors on appropriate waste management techniques and support contractors to promote waste management awareness at its development sites, as required; and - All waste generated from business activities across all operations is recycled, reused, composted, treated for energy recovery, or sent to authorized recyclers for suitable handling. Waste Collection, Segregation and Management - It is a constant effort to ensure all generated waste is suitably treated and no waste is sent to landfill at all its sites. Construction waste generated during concreting and plastering process is collected, segregated and reused in filling underneath the stich slab. Steel scrap is used in non-structural members of the building to reduce waste. In addition, to divert 36 waste from landfills, DLF tries to source or sell to recycling facilities. For example, DLF has a battery buy-back policy. - DLF has established dedicated waste collection areas and waste separation facilities at its managed sites. Solid waste undergoes segregation in specific assigned areas, where it is directed for reuse, recycling, or energy recovery, depending on the type of waste. Three types of waste are segregated and monitored as mentioned below: a. Green Bin: Biodegradable organic waste such as food waste. Wet waste collected through these bins, is transferred to organic waste composters installed on-site for composting. The manure generated from this process is used as a fertilizer for horticulture purpose in landscaping. b. Blue Bin: Other non-hazardous recyclable waste such as plastic, paper, metal waste. This dry waste is further directed for reuse, recycling through authorised vendors or sent to waste-to-energy plants. c. Black Bin: Hazardous waste items such as sanitary waste and e-waste. The e-waste and hazardous waste like used lube oil and batteries are safely disposed through Government authorized vendors, in line with regulatory requirements. Measures to reduce use of hazardous material DLF has implemented a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for materials used in construction of its buildings. MSDS provides information on the potential hazards arising from chemical properties of a product including information on health effects, reactivity, storage, handling, disposal and spill/ leak procedures, enabling personnel to work safely with the chemical product. Materials are approved and handled appropriately based on the MSDS, which helps prevent the usage of materials with any toxic content. Content",

The Company\u2019s ERPP is designed with the following broad objectives: - To assist facilities and project sites to respond to and manage emergencies in an orderly manner; To establish a robust system for notification and escalation of an emergency to appropriate levels for emergency response measures; and - To provide resolution of an incident and minimise implications for the stakeholders arising from initial and subsequent events. Following are important features of the ERPP which help ensure safety and business continuity: - Dedicated emergency response team is available at all managed sites to address such situations and minimize any adverse impacts; - ISO 45001 aligned Safety Management System has been implemented at all managed assets and disaster management system adopted for all rental and construction sites; - Periodic emergency preparedness training and awareness generation is carried out for all employees; Robust fire safety management systems in all buildings (including early warning fire detection, automatic sprinkler system, fire suppression systems etc.); - All real estate projects are developed one level above seismic zone requirements to enhance building safety in case of earthquakes. Additionally, rainwater harvesting wells have been built to prevent flooding at site; 42 - At all construction sites, common assembly points and maps at various places have been set up, so that in case of any emergency all the engaged workers can gather immediately at the assembly point; and - Safety team is available at all construction sites for monitoring and assuring that there are no lapses in any of the safety measures. 8. \u0007Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard? Real estate is an energy intensive sector, with construction and operation of buildings contributing to around 40% of global GHG emissions, making energy and resource efficiency essential to business operations, building designs as well as throughout the value chain. A large percentage of emissions generated by the real estate sector arise from the value chain, including production of construction materials. However, in FY 2022-23, there has been no significant adverse impacts to the environment arising from any of the DLF\u2019s projects.",

    "chunk": "**SEBI's Investigation into Gensol Engineering** The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has issued an interim order against Gensol Engineering and its promoters, Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi, citing serious financial misconduct. The investigation revealed that funds intended for electric vehicle procurement were diverted to purchase a \u20b943 crore luxury apartment in DLF's \"The Camellias\" project in Gurugram.\ue206 **Key Findings:** - **Diversion of Funds:** SEBI traced \u20b942.94 crore from Capbridge Ventures LLP, where both Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi are designated partners, to a payment made to DLF. The apartment was initially booked in the name of the promoters' mother, Jasminder Kaur, with a \u20b95 crore advance, which was later refunded and replaced by Capbridge as the final buyer.\ue206 - **Layered Transactions:** The funds originated from Gensol, passed through its vendor Go-Auto and related entities, before reaching DLF. The \u20b95 crore booking advance was sourced from Gensol\u2019s funds via multiple related parties and, once refunded by DLF, rerouted to another related entity\u2014Matrix Gas and Renewables. SEBI stated that these transactions demonstrate layered fund flows to disguise personal asset acquisition using public company funds.\ue206 - **Broader Financial Misconduct:** Gensol borrowed over \u20b9977 crore from institutions like IREDA and PFC for procuring 6,400 electric vehicles but acquired only 4,704, costing \u20b9567.73 crore. Nearly \u20b9262 crore remains unaccounted for, allegedly misappropriated through Go-Auto and channeled to multiple promoter-related entities.\ue206 - **Corporate Governance Failures:** SEBI noted a complete breakdown of corporate governance at Gensol, with promoters using the company\u2019s resources for personal expenses, including purchasing luxury real estate and engaging in speculative trading in Gensol\u2019s own shares via Wellray Solar.\ue206 **Regulatory Actions:** - SEBI has barred Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi from acting as directors or key managerial personnel in Gensol and prohibited them, along with Gensol, from trading in the securities market.\ue206 - A planned 1:10 stock split has been frozen to protect investors.\ue206 - A forensic audit has been ordered to examine financial records of Gensol and its related entities.\ue206 - SEBI also cited misleading disclosures by Gensol, including exaggerated claims of EV orders and strategic tie-ups, none of which were backed by binding contracts or financial rationale.\ue206 SEBI has warned retail investors to exercise caution, especially in light of the potential for promoters to offload remaining stakes and erode value further.\ue206 --- For the full article and more detailed information, you can visit the original source: \ue200link\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",

Gensol was to provide an additional equity (margin) contribution of 20%, bringing the total expected deployment of approximately Rs. 829.86 Crore for the purchase of 6,400 Electric Vehicles. Based on these figures, an amount of Rs. 262.13 Crore (Rs. 829.86 Crore \u2013 Rs. 5 6 7.73 Crore) remains unaccounted, even though more than a year has pas se d since the Company availed the last tranche of the above mentioned financi n g . 28. Given the above, to understand the end-use of funds, bank statements of both the Company and the dealer, Go-Auto, were examined. The analysis showed that once the funds were transferred from Gensol to Go-Auto, ostensibly for the purchase of EVs, they were, in most of the instances, either transferred back to the Company itself or routed to entities that were directly or indirectly related to Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, promoters and directors of Gensol. 29. Some of these funds were then used for purposes unrelated to the purpose/objective of the sanctioned term loans, which included (i) personal expenses of the promoter, including purchase of high-end real estate; (ii) benefit to the private promoter entities / transfer of funds to promoters\u2019 close relatives; etc. In order to demonstrate the nature and structure of these diversions/misutilization, the flow of funds from Gensol to Go-Auto and thereafter to entities connected to promoters of Gensol in the case of three of **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 8 of 29** ----- ### the above mentioned loans (viz. loans mentioned at serial numbers 3, 6 and 8 in the Table under Para 24), on sample basis, is discussed below. 30.

It can be noted from the above that funds availed by Gensol as loans for procuring EVs were, through layered transactions, partly utilised for buying a high-end apartment in The Camellias, DLF Gurgoan, in the name of a firm where the MD of Gensol and his brother are designated partners. 37. It was separately noted that the Rs. 5 Crore which was initially paid as booking advance by Jasminder Kaur, mother of Anmol Singh Jaggi, was also sourced from Gensol. Further, it was noted that once DLF returned the advance to Jasminder Kaur, the funds did not go back to the Company but were instead credited to another related party of Gensol viz.

No. 4 in the Table under Para 24 ). This amount (Rs.20 Crore) was also noted to have been routed through Go-Auto. Capbridge repaid Rs. 47.50 Crore to Go- Auto on March 31, 2023. 39. Upon tracing the source of this Rs. 47.50 Crore which Capbridge repaid to Go- Auto, it was observed that this amount was funded by M/s Param Care Pvt. Ltd. (a disclosed related party of Gensol), from its Overdraft Account No. 68230000001652 with Bandhan Bank. Bandhan Bank vide email dated February 12, 2025, has submitted that Overdraft facility to Param Care Pvt. Ltd. was provided on the basis of an FD of Rs. 50 Crore subscribed by Blu-Smart Mobility Pvt.

From the above, it is prima facie observed that funds amounting to Rs. 96.69 Crore (Rs. 46.65 Crore + Rs. 50.04 Crore), as mentioned at para 48 above, were diverted from the listed company and ultimately reached the private promoter related entities of Gensol. Further, it can be seen that Rs. 37.5 Crore out of the loan amount of Rs.171.30 Crore taken by Gensol EV Lease Pvt. Ltd., (a subsidiary of Gensol), from IREDA was ultimately transferred to Anmol Singh Jaggi. This aspect need further examination. 54. From the above analysis of the utilization of funds (loans) received by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, it prima-facie appears that the Company grossly mis- utilized funds and also diverted certain funds to the promoter/promoter-related entities. While the Company was to have spent an amount of Rs. 829.86 Crore (including promoter contribution) for buying EVs, bank statement analysis showed that it had transferred Rs. 775 Crore to Go-Auto against which it has obtained delivery of 4,704 EVs costing Rs. 567.73 Crore. 55. Ajay Agarwal, Managing Director of Go-Auto, in his statement recorded before SEBI on March 24, 2025, deposed that an amount of around Rs. 50 Crore was due from Gensol and therefore, Go-Auto would not be delivering anymore EVs to Gensol. 56. In this regard, Gensol has now submitted to SEBI in its communication dated April 05, 2025 that Go-Auto owes the Company an amount of Rs. 21.25 Crore as interest for which it has raised a debit note on the dealer. Interestingly, in the same letter, Gensol has noted that, on a consolidated basis, Gensol has a payable of Rs. 5.37 Crore to Go-Auto. 57. From the examination done by SEBI so far, it can be noted prima-facie that even after transferring Rs. 207.27 Crore (Rs. 775 Crore \u2013 Rs. 567.73 Crore) over and above the cost price of the 4,704 EVs that have been delivered to Gensol, the Company still had a payable of about Rs. 50 Crore to Go-Auto, as per the claim of MD of Go-Auto submitted under oath. This shortfall prima facie appears to be diversion of funds by Gensol to connected entities using Go-Auto as a conduit, which needs detailed investigation. **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 17 of 29** ----- ***Diversion of funds through a connected entity, Wellray Solar Industries Pvt. Ltd.*** ### 58. As stated above, Wellray was also one of the recipients of funds out of money borrowed by Gensol from IREDA and PFC, which was routed through Go-Auto.",

Further, up to the financial year 2019\u201320, the entire shareholding in Wellray was held by Puneet Singh Jaggi and Gensol Ventures Private Limited \u2013both promoters of Gensol. 59. Presently, almost the entire shareholding (99%) of Wellray is held by Lalit Solanki, who was employed as Regulatory Affairs Manager at the Gensol Group until December 2018, as per information available on LinkedIn. Given the same, it is prima facie observed that Wellray is connected to Gensol, both through historical promoter positions and current key managerial associations. 60. When the ledgers of Wellray in the books of Gensol were examined, it was noted that significant sales and purchases were recorded between both companies in FY 23 and FY24, the details of which are given in the Table below: |Particulars|FY 23 (Rs.

In September 2022, Gensol made a preferential issue of 12,81,993 equity shares at a price of Rs. 1,036.25/- per share to investors which included promoter group entities, details of which are given in the Table below: |Particulars|Number of shares|Amount in Crores (Rs.)| |---|---|---| |Promoter/Promoter Group|97,445|10.09| |Others|11,84,548|122.75| |Total|12,81,993|132.84| 71. Under the promoter/promoter group category, \u2018Gensol Ventures Private Limited invested Rs. 10.09 Crore in the above preferential allotment on September 26, 2022, from its Account No. 058605500770 with ICICI Bank. 72. Upon tracing the source of funds, it was noted that Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi had transferred Rs. 10.07 Crore to Gensol Ventures Private Limited on September 26, 2022. Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, had, prior to the said transfer, received funds from Wellray in the following manner: |Entity Name|Account No.|Balance before receipt of funds from Wellray (Rs.)|Amount received from Wellray (Rs.)| |---|---|---|---| |Anmol Singh Jaggi|004301520339 ICICI Bank|65.45 Lakh|5 Crore| |Puneet Singh Jaggi|004301532231 (ICICI Bank)|3.06 Lakh|5 Crore| ### 73. Further, on the same day, Wellray received funds amounting to Rs. 10 Crore from Gensol in A/c. No. 058605002357 with ICICI Bank. The balance in the said bank account of Wellray prior to this transfer was Rs. 8,81,783/-. 74.

Based on the above, it is prima facie observed that Gensol had provided funds, through layered transactions, to Gensol Ventures Private Limited (promoter of Gensol) for subscribing to 97,445 equity shares of Gensol. ***Trading in the scrip of Gensol Engineering Limited by Wellray*** ### 76. As stated in the earlier part of this Order, Wellray had utilised funds received from Gensol for trading in the Company\u2019s scrip. The details of the trades",

It was noted from the analysis of the bank statements of Wellray that out of the Rs. 137.57 Crore cumulatively transferred by Wellray to the stockbroker Sharekhan till March 2024, Rs. 101.35 Crore was received from Gensol and its related parties.

In view of the above, it is prima facie observed that Gensol and its promoters/promoter related entities have funded Wellray for trading in the scrip of Gensol which is a violation of the restrictions contained in section 67 of the Companies Act, 2013. As is also apparent from the trading in the shares of Gensol by Wellray, the latter made handsome gains from the transactions. ***Disclosures made by the Company*** ### 80. It was noted that the Company had made a disclosure dated January 28, 2025, to the exchanges that it had received pre-orders for 30,000 of its newly launched electric vehicles unveiled at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025. However, when relevant documents were called for from the Company and examined it was noted that the Orders in question were Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs) entered with 9 entities for 29,000 cars. The MOUs were in the nature of an expression of willingness with no reference to the price of the vehicle or delivery schedules. Therefore, it prima facie appeared that the Company was making misleading disclosures to investors. 81. In this regard, representative of NSE visited the plant site of Gensol Electric Vehicle Private Limited located at Gat No. 877, Next to Mahindra Towers, Khed, Nighoje, Chakan, Pune \u2013 410501 on April 09, 2025. 82.

The NSE official called for details of electricity bills of the unit and it was observed that the maximum amount billed by Mahavitaran during last 12 months was Rs. 1,57,037.01 for the month of December 2024. Hence, it can be inferred that there has been no manufacturing activity at the plant site which is on a leased property. **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 25 of 29** ----- ### 83. In another disclosure dated January 16, 2025, Gensol had informed Exchanges that Gensol and Refex Green Mobility Limited (Refex) were \u201cpleased to *announce a strategic tie-up for the transfer of 2,997 electric four-wheelers * (e4Ws)\u201d to Refex . As per the said disclosure, Refex would in turn, assume Gensol\u2019s existing loan facility amounting to Rs.315 Crore. However, in a disclosure dated March 28, 2025, the proposed takeover by Refex was withdrawn. 84. Further, vide a disclosure dated February 25, 2025, Gensol informed Exchanges that Gensol had signed a non-binding term sheet for an amount of Rs. 350 Crore for a strategic transaction involving the sale of Gensol\u2019s US Subsidiary, viz., Scorpius Trackers Inc. It was noted that the said US Subsidiary was incorporated on July 22, 2024. When probed by SEBI regarding the basis of such valuation of Rs.350 Crore, Gensol has failed to submit any explanation / rationale. ***Pledge of Shares made by Promoters to IREDA*** ### 85. As mentioned in para 6 above, the shareholding of the promoters of Gensol had come down to 35.125% as of March 31, 2025. The promoters now hold 1,33,48,359 shares in the Company. 86. We have been informed by IREDA vide email dated April 11, 2025 that promoters have created pledges for 75.74 Lakh shares of Gensol. Further, the latest pledge invocation data available on the BSE website, indicates that more pledges have been invoked during this month. This would lead to the possible conclusion that promoter shareholding in Gensol would become even lower, may be negligible, if IREDA were to invoke the pledge created by Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi. **Prima facie violations found against the Noticees ** 87. In the above paragraphs, the prima facie findings have shown mis-utilization and diversion of funds of the Company in a fraudulent manner by its promoter directors, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, who are also the direct beneficiaries of the diverted funds, as has been detailed above. The Company **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 26 of 29** ----- ### has attempted to mislead SEBI, the CRAs, the lenders and the investors by submitting forged Conduct Letters purportedly issued by its lenders. In view of these prima facie findings, the Noticees 1, 2 and 3 are alleged to have violated the provisions of Section 12A(a), (b) and (c) of the SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulations 3(b), (c) and (d), 4(1) and 4(2)(f), (k) & (r) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent",

    "chunk": "and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003. 88. Further, the above paragraphs in this Order have also shown how the promoters and their related parties / relatives benefitted from the funds of Gensol, a listed company, through layered transactions, such transactions qualified to be related party transactions in terms of Regulation 2(zc) of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (LODR Regulations, 2015). Accordingly, such transactions were required to be disclosed as per the provisions of Regulation 4 and 48 of the LODR Regulations, 2015 read with applicable accounting standards, which Gensol has allegedly failed to do. **Need for Interim Directions ** 89. What has been witnessed in the present matter is a complete breakdown of internal controls and corporate governance norms in Gensol, a listed company. The promoters were running a listed public company as if it were a propriety firm. The Company\u2019s funds were routed to related parties and used for unconnected expenses, as if the Company\u2019s funds were promoters\u2019 piggybank. The result of these transactions would mean that the diversions mentioned above would, at some time, need to be written off from the Company\u2019s books, ultimately resulting in losses to the investors of the Company. 90. While the fund diversion primarily occurred in the context of electric vehicle (EV) purchases intended for leasing to a related party, the risk it creates is neither isolated nor contained. The company has a substantial order book, comprising critical infrastructure contracts awarded by government and public sector entities in the renewable EPC space. These contracts are not just capital- **___________________________________________________________________________ ** **Interim Order in the matter of Gensol Engineering Limited Page 27 of 29** ----- ### intensive - they also require strict financial discipline, timely execution, and reputational credibility to retain project flow and institutional trust. 91. In the instant case, prima facie evidence of blatant violation of rules of corporate governance is writ large over the workings of the Company. The diversion of funds of the Company by promoter entities reflects a culture of weak internal control, where even ring-fenced borrowings from institutional creditors were rerouted at the total discretion of the promoters. The internal controls at Gensol appear to be loose and through the quick layering of transactions, funds have seamlessly flowed to multiple related entities/individuals. 92. The promoter holding in the Company has already come down substantially and there is a risk of the promoters (Noticees 2 and 3) further off-loading the shares on gullible investors. Thus, investors need to be made aware of the alleged wrongdoings detailed above through regulatory action. At the same time, allowing Noticees 2 and 3 to remain at the helm of affairs as directors or KMPs in the Company is likely to do further damage to the interests of the Company. 93. It must be mentioned that Gensol recently announced stock split of its shares in the ratio of 1:10, which is likely to attract more retail investors to the scrip. At this stage, allowing this Corporate Action may not be in the interest of the investors. 94. In view",

See [markitdown-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown/tree/main/packages/markitdown-mcp) for more information. Important Breaking changes between 0.0.1 to 0.1.0: * Dependencies are now organized into optional feature-groups (further details below). Use `pip install 'markitdown[all]'` to have backward-compatible behavior. * convert\\_stream() now requires a binary file-like object (e.g., a file opened in binary mode, or an io.BytesIO object). This is a breaking change from the previous version, where it previously also accepted text file-like objects, like io.StringIO. * The DocumentConverter class interface has changed to read from file-like streams rather than file paths. _No temporary files are created anymore_. If you are the maintainer of a plugin, or custom DocumentConverter, you likely need to update your code. Otherwise, if only using the MarkItDown class or CLI (as in these examples), you should not need to change anything. MarkItDown is a lightweight Python utility for converting various files to Markdown for use with LLMs and related text analysis pipelines. To this end, it is most comparable to [textract](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract), but with a focus on preserving important document structure and content as Markdown (including: headings, lists, tables, links, etc.) While the output is often reasonably presentable and human-friendly, it is meant to be consumed by text analysis tools -- and may not be the best option for high-fidelity document conversions for human consumption. At present, MarkItDown supports: * PDF * PowerPoint * Word * Excel * Images (EXIF metadata and OCR) * Audio (EXIF metadata and speech transcription) * HTML * Text-based formats (CSV, JSON, XML) * ZIP files (iterates over contents) * Youtube URLs * EPubs * ... and more! Why Markdown? ------------- [](#why-markdown) Markdown is extremely close to plain text, with minimal markup or formatting, but still provides a way to represent important document structure. Mainstream LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-4o, natively \"_speak_\" Markdown, and often incorporate Markdown into their responses unprompted. This suggests that they have been trained on vast amounts of Markdown-formatted text, and understand it well. As a side benefit, Markdown conventions are also highly token-efficient. Installation ------------ [](#installation) To install MarkItDown, use pip: `pip install 'markitdown[all]'`. Alternatively, you can install it from the source: ``` git clone git@github.com:microsoft/markitdown.git cd markitdown pip install -e 'packages/markitdown[all]' ``` Usage ----- [](#usage) ### Command-Line [](#command-line) ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf > document.md ``` Or use `-o` to specify the output file: ``` markitdown path-to-file.pdf -o document.md ``` You can also pipe content: ``` cat path-to-file.pdf | markitdown ``` ### Optional Dependencies [](#optional-dependencies) MarkItDown has optional dependencies for activating various file formats. Earlier in this document, we installed all optional dependencies with the `[all]` option. However, you can also install them individually for more control. For example: ``` pip install 'markitdown[pdf, docx, pptx]' ``` will install only the dependencies for PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] ## The company notes that \u2018the commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers\u2019 range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles\u2019. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: \u2018Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 ----- ## software engineering\u2019. [3] The company observes: \u2018We believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.\u2019 [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors\u2019 biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X.",

There are also striking synergies between his various ventures. Tesla Motors is reinforced by such infrastructure projects as SolarCity [6] and the Gigafactory. [7] Traditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of intellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: \u2018Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.\u2019 [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles.

[ 24] ## This approach certainly seems to be one that is focused the protection of intellectual property through patent law, and a combination of other supplementary forms of intellectual property. Maulin Shah has provided a useful analysis of the patent portfolio of Tesla Motors in terms of infographics. [25] Shah comments: 120 of Tesla\u2019s patents are related to battery and charging technologies, and not surprisingly, this technology makes up the vast majority of its patent portfolio. Tesla also owns 20 patents related to electric motor and drive control, 10 patents on vehicle frames and chassis, followed by a handful of patents related to doors/latches, air conditioning technology, sunroofs (note the signature panoramic roofs of the Model S), and user interfaces/displays. [26] ## Shah notes the competition in the area: \u2018However, while Tesla may not have much competition in the commercial marketplace for purely electric vehicles, automotive giants such as General Motors, Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and Daimler have all amassed significant patent portfolios related to electric vehicle technology.\u2019 [27] 24",

Elon Musk noted that Tesla Motors, at first, sought to build a significant patent portfolio: \u2018At Tesla, however, we felt compelled to create patents out of concern that the big car companies would copy our technology and then use their massive manufacturing, sales and marketing power to overwhelm Tesla\u2019. [36] The company developed a significant portfolio of patents in respect of electric cars and associated infrastructure. Elon Musk observed, though, that such an assumption was incorrect: \u2018The unfortunate reality is the opposite: electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn\u2019t burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales.\u2019 [37] He lamented: \u2018At best, the large automakers are producing electric cars with limited range in limited volume\u2019. [38] Musk observed that some automobile manufacturers produced \u2018no zero emission cars at all\u2019. [39] Tesla Motors has been involved in a number of legal skirmishes in respect of intellectual property. In a 2013 dispute, Tesla Motors was involved in a skirmish with pointSET.

This system essentially allows owner to pre-cool or pre-heat the cabin of a plugged-in Model S. Of course, this is a feature that we\u2019re sure all Model S owners use on almost a daily basis.

This conflict was eventually settled, with Toyota Motors paying royalties to Paice LLC. The dispute highlighted that there are major patent thickets surrounding green cars and green transportation.

That is, if a technologist practiced one of Tesla\u2019s patents, would they really be free from liability?\u2019 Greenberg ponders whether the statements by Musk by themselves would be sufficient: Sure, Tesla may be estopped from enforcing its patents\u2014though estoppel requires reasonable reliance and this announcement is so vague that it\u2019s difficult to imagine the reliance that would be reasonable\u2014 and Tesla isn\u2019t in the patent trolling business anyway. (Sorry, patent-assertion-entity business). But what if Tesla sold its patents or went bankrupt. Could a third party not enforce the patents? If it could, patents promised to be open source would seem a rich market for PAEs. Tesla is not to first to pledge its patents as open source. In fact, as Clark Asay pointed out, IBM has already been accused of reneging the promise. (See: \u201cIBM now appears to be claiming the right to nullify the 2005 pledge at its sole discretion, rendering it a meaningless confidence trick.\u201d) The questions raised by the Tesla announcement are, thus, not new. And, given enough time, courts will have to answer them.

Some members of the intellectual property profession have defended the legitimacy of the patent regime in light of Elon Musk\u2019s comments. Philip Totaro provided a thoughtful riposte. [63] He observed: \u2018While this is a noble and well-intentioned move, unfortunately, this thought process represents a widely held misconception about intellectual property: that it is only a legal matter, rather than a commercial one.\u2019 [64] Totaro responded: Patents are not just about hitting the \u2018litigation lottery\u2019 as Mr. Musk put it.

He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: \u2018If Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.\u2019 [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for \u2018good faith\u2019 uses of its patents \u2014 which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against \u2018bad faith\u2019 uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: \u2018There\u2019s a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce\u2019.

Lawrence Lessig helped set up the Creative Commons in order to facilitate accessible licensing across a wide range of copyright works.

Lane observed: \u2018So the Tesla-Patent Commons is very significant, and unlike any prior (small \u201ce\u201d) eco-patent commons, but the commercial and legal realities of dealing with patents and positioning technological businesses to be free to operate are always extremely complex.\u2019 [81] He commented upon the gambit by Tesla Motors: \u2018Ultimately, the impact of Musk\u2019s decision may turn on to what extent other such players will be motivated to invest in manufacturing vehicles, batteries, etc. using Tesla\u2019s patented and patent-pending technology with the obvious upside being the proven innovation that technology brings and the down side being no exclusivity, instead of investing in their own R&D and patent protection where the upside may be exclusivity and the down side may be inferior or unproven technologies.\u2019 [82] Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams have argued for the use of open source strategies in respect of clean technologies.

[100] He was enthusiastic about the rise of Tesla Motors, and its rapid growth in the automobile marketplace: Tesla fashions itself a Silicon Valley computer company, closer in spirit and thinking to Apple and Google than to its Detroit forebears. Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s CEO, did not deny the possibility of his own company being acquired by a \u201cdeep pockets\u201d company like Apple. Prizes are one thing, but when the rubber hits the proverbial road, unit sales are what matter in the auto industry. When market figures for the second quarter of 2013 were released, Tesla had outsold Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Audi in the \u201clarge luxury\u201d category, according to Green Car reports. [101] ## Seba maintained that \u2018the electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car industry (and with it the oil industry) swiftly and permanently.\u2019 [102] He observed that \u2018even worse from the standpoint of gasoline and diesel cars, the EV is not just a disruptive technology; the whole business model that the auto industry has built over the past century will be obliterated.\u2019 [103] Seba suggested that there are nine reasons why the electric vehicle industry will be disruptive. He noted that the electric motor is more energy efficient; the electric vehicle is cheaper to charge; and it is cheaper to maintain. Seba noted that the electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car aftermarket. He wondered about the potential for wireless charging. 100 Tony Seba, *Clean Disruption of Energy",

He has also emphasized the combination of big data and fast product development: The difference between the value of Tesla\u2019s electric miles and GM\u2019s gasoline miles has to do with data. Think of an electric vehicle as a mobile computer. Electric Vehicles generate vast amounts of data. A car company sifting through this data can learn and adapt far more quickly than a company without user data. A car company that collects data about its cars can understand customer usage patterns and technology stresses and failures. It can quickly fix mistakes, download new software to the cars, and develop new products and services. The electric vehicle product development process is shortened; it resembles the computer industry\u2019s ultra-fast development cycles. Tesla and the other electric vehicle companies will be on a product development cycle at the exponential speeds of Moore\u2019s Law; Detroit will be on conventional linear speeds. [104] ## Seba also makes the point that solar and electric vehicles are more land efficient. Moreover, electric vehicles can contribute to grid storage and other services. Seba concludes that the \u2018electric vehicle changes the basis of competition in the transportation industry.\u2019 [105] He predicts that \u2018neither the high-end or low-end gasoline car stands a chance against electric vehicles once electric vehicles are in the same price range.\u2019 [106] Seba also makes the interesting argument that electric cars will be enhanced by technology convergence in respect of clean technologies. He commented: \u2018In the clean energy field, the disruptors (solar, electric vehicles, and autonomous cars), complement and accelerate one another\u2019s adoption\u2019. [107] He maintained that \u2018solar, the electric vehicle, and the autonomous 104 Ibid., 111. 105 Ibid., 126. 106 Ibid., 127. 107 Ibid., 7. 29 ----- ## vehicle started out as different sets of products and markets, but their symbiosis will complement and accelerate one another\u2019s technological development and adoption in the marketplace.\u2019 [108] Seba envisaged: Increasing investments in electricity storage technologies in the automotive industry have led to more innovation and a subsequent drop in the cost of batteries like Lithium-Ion. As Li-on batteries become cheaper, they can increasingly be used \u2013 and economically be used \u2013 for solar and wind energy storage. The increased demand from solar and wind increases the scale of existing Li-on providers, which in turn pushes down the cost of electric vehicles, solar, and wind. The increasing demand for electric vehicles and solar will attract even more investment in these technologies. Innovative companies that can invent new ways to push costs down and push quality up will thrive. This virtuous cycle of increasing demand, increasing investment, and increasing innovation will dramatically lower costs; it will exponentially improve the quality benefits to both the clean energy and clean transportation industries; it will also lead to a convergence in which batteries can be",

A BMW spokesman said: \u2018Both companies are strongly committed to the success of electro-mobility and discussed how to further strengthen the development of electro-mobility on an international level.\u2019 [113] There has been speculation about the development of a long-term deal between the two companies. [114] Writing in Slate, Will Oremus considered the announcement of Tesla Motors from a business perspective.

[126] He reflected upon the initiative: Patents have often been seen as a necessary evil required to protect innovators from having their ideas stolen. However, they can also limit the development of a new industry, keep innovation at bay, and smother technological advancement. If we are to use business as a force for good, then we should welcome competition and relax fixation on intellectual property. Very impressed by the news that electric car company, Tesla Motors have frozen their patent portfolio to help accelerate sustainable transport. In the spirit of the open source movement, the company\u2019s CEO, Elon Musk announced that Tesla won\u2019t raise patent lawsuits against anyone who uses their technology in good faith. Just last week, a wall of patents was removed from the company\u2019s Palo Alto headquarters to demonstrate the message. [127] ## Branson provides a somewhat scrambled account of the nature and the role of patent law. Branson cited former The B Team CEO, Derek Handley who said: \u2018By holding on tightly to the knowledge and protection of ideas and intellectual property that is enabling this race to gain momentum, they are holding the world back from getting to where we all want it to 124 Ibid. 125 Ibid. 126 Richard Branson, \u2018Breaking Down the Patent Wall\u2019, Virgin.com, 19 June 2014, http://www.virgin.com/richard - branson/breaking - down - the - patent - wall 127 Ibid. 33 ----- ## be.\u2019 [128] He commented: \u2018At Virgin, we welcome competition \u2013 it challenges us to constantly innovative and",

Branson has also been a supporter of Musk\u2019s efforts. [ 132] He has commented: \u2018My good friend Elon Musk is in the fast lane of electric vehicle development as Tesla power ahead with sales and growth\u2019. [133] Branson noted: \u2018However some Virgin staff notified me that Tesla are facing some opposition from industry incumbents who want to prevent Tesla from selling directly to customers.\u2019 [134] He observed: \u2018Whilst nobody wants to undermine peoples livelihoods, if we are to conduct our businesses and industries in ways that profitably help people and the planet some things will have to change.\u2019 [135] Branson argued: \u2018In this instance, I think that, by shaking up the United States automaker industry, Tesla are doing a very good thing, and I 128 Ibid. 129 Ibid. 130 Ibid. 131 Ibid. 132 Richard Branson, \u2018Allow Tesla Motors to Sell Directly to Consumers\u2019, Virgin.Com, 19 August 2013, http://www.virgin.com/richard - branson/allow - tesla - motors - to - sell - directly - to - consumers 133 Ibid. 134 Ibid. 135 Ibid. 34 ----- ## would greatly encourage you to sign this White House petition (organised by the public) to allow Tesla Motors to sell directly to consumers in all 50 states.\u2019 [136] There has been pessimism amongst some critics that the automobile industry will squander the present offered by Tesla Motors. Jason Perlow wrote an incisive piece entitled, \u2018Why Detroit will Squander Tesla\u2019s Patent Present.\u2019 [137] He suggested: \u2018I suspect that one of the reasons behind Elon Musk\u2019s open source motivations is that he is looking for large partners to finance and build the many \u201cgigafactories\u201d needed to mass-produce the batteries at scale, which is the single largest component cost of his cars, and the patent portfolio of Tesla is the \u201ccarrot.\u201d\u2019 [138] Perlow wondered whether traditional manufacturers would invest in electric cars: \u2018In order for the Big Three and the rest to make that leap, even with the patents, they will need to make substantial investments, on the order of many billions of dollars.\u2019 [139] He observed that there were longstanding relationships between the automobile manufacturers and the oil industry. Perlow concluded: \u2018Unless our world governments step in and give them huge incentives to do otherwise, I don\u2019t see the big auto manufacturers taking advantage of Musk\u2019s gifts and breaking up a century-old romance with Big Oil.\u2019 [140] 136 Ibid. 137 Jason Perlow, \u2018Why Detroit Will Squander Tesla\u2019s Patent Present\u2019, ZDNet, 17 June 2014, http://www.zdnet.com/why - detroit - will - squander - teslas - patent - present - 7000030497/ 138 Ibid. 139 Ibid. 140 Ibid. 35 ----- ## James Bessen, an economist",

In its annual report, Tesla Motors highlights the role of marketing in respect of electric cars. The company notes: \u2018As the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant, fully electric vehicle that achieves market-leading range on a single charge, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our vehicles, and we believe we will continue to do so\u2019. [144] Tesla Motors has certainly excelled at marketing and branding clean technology (which has sometimes been rather dour by comparison to other sectors). Elon Musk has certainly shown a Steve Jobs-like elan and bravura at salesmanship and promotion. The company Tesla Motors has also been involved in battles over other forms of intellectual property \u2014 most notably, in respect of trade marks relating to the United States, [145] and China. [146] It is striking that the company has not espoused an open source philosophy when it comes to trade mark law. In its annual report for 2012, Tesla Motors highlighted that its trademark applications in certain countries remain subject to outstanding opposition proceedings: 144 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 145 Kirsten Korosec, \u2018Tesla Drops Model E Trademark, but Ford Hangs On\u2019, *Fortune*, 7 May 2014, http://fortune.com/2014/05/07/tesla - drops - model - e - trademark - but - ford - hangs - on/ 146 John Voelcker, \u2018Tesla Gets its Brand Name Back in China, via Court Decision\u2019, *Green Car Reports*, 24 January 2014, http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1089903 _ tesla - gets - its - brand - name - back - in - china - via court - decision 37 ----- We currently sell and market our vehicles in various countries under our Tesla marks. We have filed trademark applications for our Tesla marks and opposition proceedings to trademark applications of third parties in various countries in which we currently sell and plan to sell our vehicles. Certain of our trademark applications are subject to outstanding opposition proceedings brought by owners or applicants alleging prior use of similar marks. If we cannot resolve these oppositions and thereby secure registered rights in these countries, our ability to challenge third party users of the Tesla marks will be reduced and the value of the marks representing our exclusive brand name in these countries will be diluted. In addition, there is a risk that the prior rights owners could in the future take actions to challenge our use of the Tesla marks in these countries. Such actions could have a severe impact on our position in these countries and may inhibit our ability to use the Tesla marks in these countries. If we were prevented from using the Tesla marks in any or all of these countries, we would need to expend significant additional financial and marketing resources on establishing an alternative brand identity in these markets.

In response, on the 3 [rd] December 2013, Ford\u2019s lawyers filed a trademark application in respect of the name \u2018Model E.\u2019 Clearly, the company was conscious of its historical tradition of using letters to name cars \u2013 most famously, with the Model T. In April 2014, Tesla Motors\u2019 abandoned its trademark application in respect of the \u2018Model E\u2019. [ 151] There seems to have been an amicable resolution of the dispute between the car companies. In China, Tesla Motors encountered a number of troubles in respect of trademark law. [152] Professor Eric Lane from Thomas Jefferson School of Law has been following the longstanding conflict, and has provided a useful summary of the dispute: As it sought to expand into the Chinese market, the electric car maker encountered a businessman named Zhan Baosheng who owned registrations for the TESLA (or \u201cTe Si La\u201d transliterated) trademark in China in both English and Chinese. While Zhan\u2019s trademark rights initially blocked Tesla from using the mark there, in early 2014 the company announced that **it had resolved the** **matter** though a court decision granting it the right to use the TESLA mark in China.

There appeared to be a settlement, in return for the ownership of the trademarks, and the website names registered in China, such as tesla.cn and teslamotors.cn. [154] The company observed \u2018Mr. Zhan has agreed to have the Chinese authorities complete the process of cancelling the Tesla trademarks that he had registered or applied for, at no cost to Tesla.\u2019 [155] The company noted: \u2018Collectively, these actions remove any doubt with respect to Tesla\u2019s undisputed rights to its trademarks in China.\u2019 [156] Tesla Motors declined to discuss the financial settlement in respect of the transfer of the ownership of the domain names.

[158] In addition to trademark law, Tesla Motors has also been involved in unsuccessful defamation litigation in the United Kingdom against BBC over disparaging reviews of the performance of its cars on the show Top Gear. [159] Tesla Motors complained about Jeremy Clarkson, saying: \u2018Although Tesla say it will do 200 miles, we worked out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles and if it does run out, it is not a quick job to charge it up again.\u2019 [160] Tesla Motors pleaded that there had been libel and malicious falsehood. The British Courts were sceptical of such claims. In the Court of Appeals, Lord Moore-Bick observed: \u2018In my view the case pleaded in support of the claim for special damages is, to say the least, very thin on its own terms\u2019.

On the 14th June 2014, President Barack Obama gave a commencement address to the University of California, Irvine. He told his audience: We need scientists to design new fuels. We need farmers to help grow them. We need engineers to invent new technologies. We need entrepreneurs to sell those technologies. We need workers to operate assembly lines that hum with high-tech, zero-carbon components. We need builders to hammer into place the foundations for a clean energy age.

Gigafactory ** In February 2014, Tesla Motors announced its ambition to establish a Gigafactory: As we at Tesla reach for our goal of producing a mass market electric car in approximately three years, we have an opportunity to leverage our projected demand for lithium ion batteries to reduce their cost faster than previously thought possible. In cooperation with strategic battery manufacturing partners, we\u2019re planning to build a large scale factory that will allow us to achieve economies of scale and minimize costs through innovative manufacturing, reduction of logistics waste, optimization of co-located processes and reduced overhead. The Gigafactory is designed to reduce cell costs much faster than the status quo and, by 2020, produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013. By the end of the first year of volume production of our mass market vehicle, we expect the Gigafactory will have driven down the per kWh cost of our battery pack by more than 30 percent.

What we are trying to address is not the lay of the land today, where there are indeed too many suppliers, most of whom are producing relatively low photonic efficiency solar cells at uncompelling costs, but how we see the future developing. Without decisive action to lay the groundwork today, the massive volume of affordable, high efficiency panels needed for unsubsidized solar power to outcompete fossil fuel grid power simply will not be there when it is needed. SolarCity was founded to accelerate mass adoption of sustainable energy. The sun, that highly convenient and free fusion reactor in the sky, radiates more energy to the Earth in a few hours than the entire human population consumes from all sources in a year. This means that solar panels, paired with batteries to enable power at night, can produce several orders of magnitude more electricity than is consumed by the entirety of human civilization. A cogent assessment of sustainable energy potential from various sources is described well in this Sandia paper:www.sandia.gov/~jytsao/Solar%20FAQs.pdf. Even if the solar industry were only to generate 40 percent of the world\u2019s electricity with photovoltaics by 2040, that would mean installing more than 400 GW of solar capacity per year for the next 25 years. We absolutely believe that solar power can and will become the world\u2019s predominant source of energy within our lifetimes, but there are obviously a **lot** of panels that have to be manufactured and installed in order for that to happen. The plans we are announcing today, while substantial compared to current industry, are small in that context. [196]",

[200] He has been particularly enthusiastic about solar photovoltaics: There is surprising \u2013 even shocking \u2013 good news: Our ability to convert sunshine into usable energy has become much cheaper far more rapidly than anyone had predicted. The cost of electricity from photovoltaic, or PV, solar cells is now equal to or less than the cost of electricity from other sources powering electric grids in at least 79 countries. By 2020 \u2013 as the scale of deployments grows and the costs continue to decline \u2013 more than 80 percent of the world's people will live in regions where solar will be competitive with electricity from other sources.
